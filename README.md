# TOP-Rock-Paper-Scissors
First iteration:
The game is fully designed in Javascript, the GUI will be developed later on. Will be using functions to get the computers choice and use conditional statements to determine the winner. Assumed the user entered the correct input, if not it defaults to rock. 

Second iteration:
Created a graphical interface for the user to be more interactive using buttons. Made use of eventListeners and DOM manipulation. The design is very basic but still took a while to get everything working. Each game plays up to 5 points to win.
